# Tower of Hanoi Solver

## Overview
This is the README for the Tower of Hanoi Solver project, which is part of my first artificial intelligence course at my University. This project focuses on solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using object-oriented programming in Java. The goal is to implement various search algorithms, including breadth-first search, depth-first search, best-first search, and A* search, to find the optimal solution to the puzzle while considering specified states, move costs, and heuristic functions.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

  - `Main.java`: The main entry point of the program.
  - `Graph.java`: A class representing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle as a graph, including state representation, move validation and where search algorithms are created.
  - `Node.java`: A class representing the node and it's cost.
  - `Path.java`: A class representing the path between nodes and it's cost.

## Getting Started
To run the Tower of Hanoi Solver project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/FreddyAssaf/Tower-of-Hanoi-solver.git
